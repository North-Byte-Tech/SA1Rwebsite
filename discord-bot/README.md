# sa1r-discord-bot

Standalone Node.js process (not a FiveM resource). Ported from the main SFOS
repo (`SFRP_Core`)'s `services/discord-bot` into this website workspace, with
extra website integration. Run it on a host that can reach the game database and
the website; it also needs network access to FXServer for permission sync.

Jobs:
1. **Role sync** — keeps `permission_grants` in sync with Discord role
   membership. Grants flow from Discord roles into `permission_grants`, and
   the bot notifies FXServer through `FXSERVER_SYNC_URL`.
2. **Slash commands** (`/grant-permission`, `/revoke-permission`,
   `/lookup-player`) for staff to manage a linked player's permissions.
3. **Audit log** (optional) — posts an embed to a Discord channel for game
   events (connect/disconnect, character creation, duty status, etc.).
4. **FiveM whitelist sync** — mirrors membership in one configured Discord
   role into the shared game database for every server using the whitelist
   resource.

## Website integration

The website integrations added on top of the ported bot are:

- **Recruitment notifications** — the website posts application lifecycle
   events directly to this bot's `POST /recruitment/:event` endpoint. The bot
   DMs applicants, and can assign configured department roles on acceptance.
   This is independent of the game audit log and does not require
   `DISCORD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID`. Configure the website's `DISCORD_BOT_WEBHOOK_URL`
   and `DISCORD_BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; the secret must match this bot's
   `DISCORD_RECRUITMENT_SECRET` (or its `FXSERVER_LOG_SECRET` fallback).

Recruitment notifications are optional; omit the website webhook settings to
disable them. `DISCORD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` only controls game audit embeds.

## Setup

1. Create a Discord application/bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Under **Bot**, enable the **Server Members Intent** (privileged) — required
   to read role membership. Copy the bot token, and copy the **Application ID**
   from General Information (this is `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, not the bot token).
3. Invite the bot with both the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`,
   `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, DB credentials, and
   `FXSERVER_SYNC_URL`/`FXSERVER_SYNC_SECRET`. Set `FXSERVER_LOG_SECRET` if
   FXServer will post audit logs. For website recruitment notifications, set
   `DISCORD_RECRUITMENT_SECRET` and configure the website with the same value
   as `DISCORD_BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, plus `DISCORD_BOT_WEBHOOK_URL` pointing to
   this bot's reachable base URL (for example,
   `http://127.0.0.1:30121`). For acceptance roles, set the relevant
   `DISCORD_ROLE_LEO`, `DISCORD_ROLE_SAFD`, and/or `DISCORD_ROLE_SAEMS` role
   IDs. Set `DISCORD_WHITELIST_ROLE_ID` to the Discord role that grants access
   to all FiveM servers; role membership is synced on bot startup, role
   changes, and Discord server departures.
5. Populate `discord_role_mappings` (see the main SFOS repo's
   `database/migrations/0002_permissions.sql`) with your Discord role IDs
   mapped to `sa1r.role.*` permissions.
6. Install the FiveM resource and create its `discord_whitelist` table by
   following [`fivem/sa1r_whitelist/README.md`](../fivem/sa1r_whitelist/README.md).
7. `pnpm install` (from repo root), then `pnpm --filter sa1r-discord-bot dev`
   for local iteration, or `pnpm --filter sa1r-discord-bot build && pnpm
   --filter sa1r-discord-bot start` to run compiled.

Slash commands are registered automatically (guild-scoped) on every start.

## Debug logging

Set `DEBUG=true` in `.env` (restart required) for verbose console output:
role sync decisions, slash command invocations, `/log` payloads received,
FXServer notification results.
