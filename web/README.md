# sa1r-web

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) community website — landing/rules,
department information and recruitment, and an admin dashboard, all as one
app gated by session + permission checks. Deployed to Vercel. Fully
self-contained: this app's own Postgres database is the only datastore -
there is no separate backend service anymore.

## Accounts and login

Signing in with Discord creates a real website account in this app's own
Postgres database (`prisma/schema.prisma`, via `@next-auth/prisma-adapter`).
That account row is the single source of truth for everything: staff
status, permissions, bans, notes, and application history all live here.

### Bootstrapping the first admin

`/admin` is gated on `sa1r.staff.admin`, managed entirely through the
`/admin` UI once at least one admin exists. To get the very first admin,
set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_DISCORD_IDS` (see `.env.example`) to your Discord user
id before signing in - `lib/auth.ts`'s `events.signIn` grants
`sa1r.staff.admin` to any listed id automatically and idempotently. It's
safe to leave set permanently for whoever should always have admin;
everyone else's access should be granted through the admin UI instead.

**Current feature set**: public pages (landing, rules, how-to-join,
department overview/detail), a live on-duty status board (`/status`,
reading this app's own `/api/status`, backed by `prisma.statusSnapshot` -
see `lib/status.ts`), a recruitment application form per department
(`/departments/[slug]/apply`, posting to `/api/applications`, which
requires only a signed-in session). Department portals are hosted separately
and will be linked from this site once their URLs are ready. Department pages
only link to `/apply` when that
department's `recruitmentOpen` flag (`lib/departments.ts`) is `true` - flip
it per department once you're ready to accept applications; the apply
route itself works regardless, for testing. The admin dashboard
(`/admin/*`) covers staff roster, bans, player notes, permissions, the
applications review queue, and a staff-action audit log - see
`lib/adminData.ts` for all of it.

## Local setup

1. Get a local Postgres running (e.g. `postgres.app`, Docker, or your
   package manager) and create a database for this app, e.g. `sa1r_web`.
2. Create a Discord application at
   https://discord.com/developers/applications, OAuth2 tab: add redirect
   URI `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`, copy the Client
   ID and Client Secret.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `DATABASE_URL`,
   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (any random string), and the Discord client id/secret.
   Set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_DISCORD_IDS` to your own Discord id so you land as
   admin on first sign-in.
4. `pnpm install` (from repo root) — this also runs `prisma generate`.
   Then create the database tables:
   `pnpm --filter sa1r-web exec prisma migrate deploy`.
5. `pnpm --filter sa1r-web dev` and open http://localhost:3000.

For quick UI iteration without any of the above, set `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`
(unset/anything but `"false"` in non-production) - every page renders as a
fixed fake signed-in admin session with zero Postgres/Discord setup. See
`lib/session.ts`.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Provision a Postgres database (Vercel Postgres, Neon, or Supabase all
   work — pick whichever, this is a plain Postgres connection string, no
   provider-specific features used).
2. Import this repo into a new Vercel project, set its **Root Directory**
   to `web`.
3. Set the same env vars as `.env.example` in the Vercel project settings
   (`DATABASE_URL` = your Postgres connection string, `NEXTAUTH_URL` = your
   real production domain).
4. Run `prisma migrate deploy` against that `DATABASE_URL` once (locally,
   with it set in your shell, or via a one-off Vercel build command) to
   create the tables before the first deploy.
5. Add a second Discord OAuth redirect URI for the production domain:
   `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/discord`.
6. If the FiveM server should push live on-duty status here, set
   `STATUS_REPORT_SECRET` and point its status-push script at
   `https://<your-domain>/api/status/report` with that secret in the
   `x-sa1r-status-secret` header.
